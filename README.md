## 🧩 I Build Things That Don’t Break Easily

I work on backend systems where:
- failure is expensive  
- performance matters  
- and shortcuts come back later as problems  

Right now, I’m building and improving real production systems, including **epamarket.uz**.

## 🔍 What I Actually Focus On

Not buzzwords. Not hype.  
These are the problems I enjoy solving:

- Designing **clear and predictable APIs**
- Handling **async flows, queues, and background jobs**
- Making systems observable, debuggable, and boring (in a good way)
- Scaling read/write-heavy backends without chaos
- Keeping codebases understandable after months — not days

## 🧠 Tools I Trust

### Core
- PHP (Laravel, deep internals, ecosystem tooling)
- Ruby (Rails mindset, conventions, structure)
- JavaScript / Node.js (backend utilities, services)

### Architecture & Backend Engineering
- REST & event-driven architecture
- Queue systems (RabbitMQ)
- Caching & rate limiting (Redis)
- Background processing & schedulers
- API versioning & backward compatibility

### Infrastructure & Ops
- Linux (Ubuntu)
- Nginx
- Docker (practical usage, not buzzword usage)
- AWS & GCP (deployment, services, environments)
- CI/CD basics & production workflows

### Data
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- SQLite
- Query optimization & indexing strategies

## 🧭 How I Think About Software

I prefer:
- explicit code over clever code  
- predictable systems over “smart” ones  
- documentation through structure, not comments  

If a system needs constant explanation — it’s already failing.

## 🐉 A Personal Note

I like dragons — not as fantasy, but as a metaphor.

They don’t rush.  
They don’t show off.  
They survive centuries.

That’s how I want my software to behave.

Software should feel calm under pressure.  
If it panics, the design is wrong.
